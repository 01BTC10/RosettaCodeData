[[wp:Floyd's triangle|Floyd's triangle]] lists the natural numbers in a right triangle aligned to the left where
* the first row is just 1
* successive rows start towards the left with the next number followed by successive naturals listing one more number than the line above.

The first few lines of a Floyd triangle looks like this:
<pre> 1
 2  3
 4  5  6
 7  8  9 10
11 12 13 14 15</pre>

The task is to:
# Write a program to generate and display here the first n lines of a Floyd triangle.<br>(Use n=5 and n=14 rows).
# Ensure that when displayed in a monospace font, the numbers line up in vertical columns as shown and that only one space separates numbers of the last row.
