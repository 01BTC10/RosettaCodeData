A block comment begins with a ''beginning delimiter'' and ends with a ''ending delimiter'', including the delimiters. These delimiters are often multi-character sequences.

'''Task:''' Strip block comments from program text (of a programming language much like classic [[C]]). Your demos should at least handle simple, non-nested and multiline block comment delimiters. The beginning delimiter is the two-character sequence “<tt>/*</tt>” and the ending delimiter is “<tt>*/</tt>”.

Sample text for stripping:
<pre>
  /**
   * Some comments
   * longer comments here that we can parse.
   *
   * Rahoo
   */
   function subroutine() {
    a = /* inline comment */ b + c ;
   }
   /*/ <-- tricky comments */

   /**
    * Another comment.
    */
    function something() {
    }
</pre>

'''Extra credit:''' Ensure that the stripping code is not hard-coded to the particular delimiters described above, but instead allows the caller to specify them. (If your language supports them, [[Optional parameters|optional parameters]] may be useful for this.)
