Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100.

But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number,
and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". <br>
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". [http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/dont-overthink-fizzbuzz.html]

FizzBuzz was presented as the lowest level of comprehension
required to illustrate adequacy. [http://blog.codinghorror.com/fizzbuzz-the-programmers-stairway-to-heaven/]
