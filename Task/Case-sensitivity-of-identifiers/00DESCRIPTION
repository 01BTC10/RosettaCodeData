Three dogs (Are there three dogs or one dog?) is a code snippet used to illustrate the lettercase sensitivity of the programming language. For a case-sensitive language, the identifiers dog, Dog and DOG are all different and we should get the output:

The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.

For a language that is lettercase insensitive, we get the following output:

There is just one dog named Bernie.
