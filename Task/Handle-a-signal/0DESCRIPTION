Most general purpose operating systems provide interrupt facilities, sometimes called signals. Unhandled signals generally terminate a program in a disorderly manner. Signal handlers are created so that the program behaves in a well-defined manner upon receipt of a signal.

For this task you will provide a program that displays a single integer on each line of output at the rate of one integer in each half second. Upon receipt of the SigInt signal (often created by the user typing ctrl-C) the program will cease printing integers to its output, print the number of seconds the program has run, and then the program will terminate.
