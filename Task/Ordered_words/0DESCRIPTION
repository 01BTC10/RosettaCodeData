Define an ordered word as a word in which the letters of the word appear in alphabetic order. Examples include 'abbey' and 'dirt'.

The task is to find ''and display'' all the ordered words in this [http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt dictionary] that have the longest  word length. (Examples that access the dictionary file locally assume that you have downloaded this file yourself.)  The display needs to be shown on this page.
