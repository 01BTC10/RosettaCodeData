The task is to write a program where the program chooses a number between 1 and 10. A player is then prompted to enter a guess. If the player guess wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct. When the player has made a successful guess the computer will give a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

A [[:Category:Conditional loops|conditional loop]] may be used to repeat the guessing until the user is correct.
