The Hailstone sequence of numbers can be generated from a starting positive integer, n by:
* If n is 1 then the sequence ends.
* If n is even then the next n of the sequence <code>= n/2</code>
* If n is odd  then the next n of the sequence <code>= (3 * n) + 1</code>

The (unproven), [[wp:Collatz conjecture|Collatz conjecture]] is that the hailstone sequence for any starting number always terminates.

'''Task Description:'''
# Create a routine to generate the hailstone sequence for a number.
# Use the routine to show that the hailstone sequence for the number 27 has 112 elements starting with <code>27, 82, 41, 124</code> and ending with <code>8, 4, 2, 1</code>
# Show the number less than 100,000 which has the longest hailstone sequence together with that sequence's length.<br> (But don't show the actual sequence!)
