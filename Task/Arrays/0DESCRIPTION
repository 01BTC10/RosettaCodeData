This task is about arrays. For hashes or associative arrays, please
see [[Creating an Associative Array]].

In this task, the goal is to show basic array syntax in your
language. Basically, create an array, assign a value to it, and
retrieve an element. (if available, show both fixed-length arrays and
dynamic arrays, pushing a value into it.)

Please discuss at Village Pump: {{vp|Arrays}}.  Please merge code in from obsolete tasks [[Creating an Array]], [[Assigning Values to an Array]], and [[Retrieving an Element of an Array]].
