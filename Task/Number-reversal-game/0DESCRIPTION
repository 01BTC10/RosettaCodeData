Given a jumbled list of the numbers 1 to 9 that are definitely ''not'' in ascending order, show the list then
ask the player how many digits from the left to reverse.
Reverse those digits, then ask again, until all the
digits end up in ascending order.

The score is the count of the reversals needed to attain the ascending order.

Note: Assume the players input does not need extra validation.
