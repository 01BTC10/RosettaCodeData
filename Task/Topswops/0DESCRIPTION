Topswops is a card game created by John Conway in the 1970's.

Assume you have a particular permutation of a set of n cards numbered 1..n on both of their faces, for example the arrangement of four cards given by [2, 4, 1, 3] where the leftmost card is on top. A round is composed of reversing the first m cards where m is the value of the topmost card. rounds are repeated until the topmost card is the number 1 and the number of swaps is recorded. For our example the swaps produce:
<pre>    [2, 4, 1, 3]    # Initial shuffle
    [4, 2, 1, 3]
    [3, 1, 2, 4]
    [2, 1, 3, 4]
    [1, 2, 3, 4]</pre>
For a total of four swaps from the initial ordering to produce the terminating case where 1 is on top.


For a particular number <code>n</code> of cards, <code>topswops(n)</code> is the maximum swaps needed for any starting permutation of the n cards.

;Task:
The task is to generate and show here a table of <code>n</code> vs <code>topswops(n)</code> for n in the range 1..10 inclusive.

[[oeis:A000375|Topswops]] is also known as [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Shootout/Fannkuch Fannkuch] from the German Pfannkuchen meaning [http://youtu.be/3biN6nQYqZY pancake].
