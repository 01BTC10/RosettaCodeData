[[wp:Heron's formula|Hero's formula]] for the area of a triangle given the length of its three sides
''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' is given by:

:<math>A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)},</math>

where ''s'' is half the perimeter of the triangle; that is,

:<math>s=\frac{a+b+c}{2}.</math>

'''[http://www.had2know.com/academics/heronian-triangles-generator-calculator.html Heronian triangles]'''
are triangles whose sides ''and area'' are all integers.
:An example is the triangle with sides 3, 4, 5 whose area is 6 (and whose perimeter is 12).

Note that any triangle whose sides are all an integer multiple of 3,4,5; such as 6,8,10, will
also be a Heronian triangle.

Define a '''Primitive Heronian triangle''' as a Heronian triangle where the greatest common divisor
of all three sides is 1. This will exclude, for example triangle 6,8,10

'''The task''' is to:
# Create a named function/method/procedure/... that implements Hero's formula.
# Use the function to generate all the ''primitive'' Heronian triangles with sides <= 200.
# Show the count of how many triangles are found.
# Order the triangles by first increasing area, then by increasing perimeter, then by increasing maximum side lengths
# Show the first ten ordered triangles in a table of sides, perimeter, and area.
# Show a similar ordered table for those triangles with area = 210
Show all output here.

<small>'''Note''': when generating triangles it may help to restrict <math>a <= b <= c</math></small>
