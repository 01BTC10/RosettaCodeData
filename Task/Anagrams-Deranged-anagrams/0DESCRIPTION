Two or more words are said to be [[Anagrams|anagrams]] if they have the same characters, but in a different order. By analogy with [[Permutations/Derangements|derangements]] we define a deranged anagram as two words with the same characters, but in which the same character does ''not'' appear in the same position in both words.

The task is to use the word list at http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt to find and ''show'' the longest deranged anagram.
