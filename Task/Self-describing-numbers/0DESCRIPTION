There are several integers numbers called "self-describing" or "[[wp:Self-descriptive number|self-descriptive]]"

Integers with the property that, when digit positions are labeled 0 to N-1, the digit in each position is equal to the number of times that that digit appears in the number.

For example 2020 is a four digit self describing number.

Position "0" has value 2 and there is two 0 in the number. Position "1" has value 0 because there are not 1's in the number.
Position "2" has value 2 and there is two 2. And the position "3" has value 0 and there are zero 3's.

Self-describing numbers < 100.000.000: 1210 - 2020 - 21200 - 3211000 - 42101000

;Task Description
# Write a function/routine/method/... that will check whether a given positive integer is self-describing.
# As an optional stretch goal - generate and display the set of self-describing numbers.
