[[wp:Morse_code|Morse code]] is one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication in
existence. It has been in use for more than 160 years â€” longer than any other electronic encoding system.

The task: Send a string as audible morse code to an audio device (e.g., the PC speaker).

As the standard Morse code does not contain all possible characters, you may either ignore unknown characters in the file, or indicate them somehow (e.g. with a different pitch).
