Some programming languages are not exactly consistent (with other programming languages) when raising zero to the zeroth power: <math>0^0</math>.
;Task requirements
Show the results of raising zero to the zeroth power.

If your computer language objects to <code>0**0</code> at compile time,
you may also try something like:
<lang rexx>x = 0
y = 0
z = x**y

say  'z='  z</lang>
'''Show the result here.'''<br>
And of course use any symbols or notation that is supported in your computer language for exponentiation.
