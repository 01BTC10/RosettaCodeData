This task is inverse to the task [[Call foreign language function]]. Consider the following [[C]] program:
<lang c>#include <stdio.h>

extern int Query (char * Data, size_t * Length);

int main (int argc, char * argv [])
{
   char     Buffer [1024];
   size_t   Size = sizeof (Buffer);

   if (0 == Query (Buffer, &Size))
   {
      printf ("failed to call Query\n");
   }
   else
   {
      char * Ptr = Buffer;
      while (Size-- > 0) putchar (*Ptr++);
      putchar ('\n');
   }
}</lang>
Write an implementation of Query in your language and make ''main'' calling it. The function Query takes the buffer a places the string ''Here am I'' into it. The buffer size in bytes is specified by the parameter Length. When there is no room in the buffer, Query shall return 0. Otherwise it overwrites the beginning of Buffer, sets the number of overwritten bytes into Length and returns 1.
