{{wikipedia|Ternary logic}}
In [[wp:logic|logic]], a '''three-valued logic''' (also '''trivalent''', '''ternary''', or  '''trinary logic''', sometimes abbreviated '''3VL''') is any of several [[wp:many-valued logic|many-valued logic]] systems in which there are three [[wp:truth value|truth value]]s indicating ''true'', ''false'' and some indeterminate third value.
This is contrasted with the more commonly known [[wp:Principle of bivalence|bivalent]] logics (such as classical sentential or [[wp:boolean logic|boolean logic]]) which provide only for ''true'' and ''false''. Conceptual form and basic ideas were initially created by [[wp:Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]], [[wp:C. I. Lewis|Lewis]]  and [[wp:Sulski|Sulski]].
These were then re-formulated by [[wp:Grigore Moisil|Grigore Moisil]] in an axiomatic algebraic form, and also extended to ''n''-valued logics in 1945.

'''Task:'''
* Define a new type that emulates ''ternary logic'' by storing data '''trits'''.
* Given all the binary logic operators of the original programming language, reimplement these operators for the new ''Ternary logic'' type '''trit'''.
* Generate a sampling of results using '''trit''' variables.
* [[wp:Kudos|Kudos]] for actually thinking up a test case algorithm where ''ternary logic'' is intrinsically useful, optimises the test case algorithm and is preferable to binary logic.
Note: '''[[wp:Setun|Setun]]''' (Сетунь) was a [[wp:balanced ternary|balanced ternary]] computer developed in 1958 at [[wp:Moscow State University|Moscow State University]]. The device was built under the lead of [[wp:Sergei Sobolev|Sergei Sobolev]] and [[wp:Nikolay Brusentsov|Nikolay Brusentsov]]. It was the only modern [[wp:ternary computer|ternary computer]], using three-valued [[wp:ternary logic|ternary logic]]
