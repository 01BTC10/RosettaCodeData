Create a function/use an in-built function, to compute the '''[[wp:Dot product|dot product]]''', also known as the '''scalar product''' of two vectors. If possible, make the vectors of arbitrary length.

As an example, compute the dot product of the vectors <code>[1, 3, -5]</code> and <code>[4, -2, -1]</code>.

If implementing the dot product of two vectors directly, each vector must be the same length; multiply corresponding terms from each vector then sum the results to produce the answer.
