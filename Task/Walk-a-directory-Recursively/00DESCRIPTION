Walk a given directory ''tree'' and print files matching a given pattern.

'''Note:''' This task is for recursive methods.  These tasks should read an entire directory tree, not a ''single directory''.  For code examples that read a ''single directory'', see [[Walk a directory/Non-recursively]].

'''Note:''' Please be careful when running any code examples found here.
