Compute the ''n''-th term of a [[wp:Series (mathematics)|series]], i.e. the sum of the ''n'' first terms  of the corresponding [[wp:sequence|sequence]].  Informally, it is also called the ''sum of the series'', thus the title of this task.

For this task, use:

<math>S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^2}</math>

and compute <math>S_{1000}</math>.

This approximates the [[wp:Riemann zeta function|zeta function]] for s=2, whose exact value

<math>\zeta(2) = {\pi^2\over 6}</math>

is the solution of the [[wp:Basel problem|Basel problem]].
