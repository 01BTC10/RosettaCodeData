A [[wp:Almost prime|k-Almost-prime]] is a natural number <math>n</math> that is the product of <math>k</math> (possibly identical) primes.
So, for example, 1-almost-primes, where <math>k=1</math>, are the prime numbers themselves; 2-almost-primes are the [[Semiprime|semiprimes]].

The task is to write a function/method/subroutine/... that generates k-almost primes and use it to create a table here of the first ten members of k-Almost primes for <math>1 <= K <= 5</math>.
