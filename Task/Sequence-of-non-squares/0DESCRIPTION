Show that the following remarkable formula gives the [http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A000037 sequence] of non-square [[wp:Natural_number|natural numbers]]:
  n + floor(1/2 + sqrt(n))
* Print out the values for n in the range 1 to 22
* Show that no squares occur for n less than one million
* This sequence is also known as [http://oeis.org/A000037 A000037].
