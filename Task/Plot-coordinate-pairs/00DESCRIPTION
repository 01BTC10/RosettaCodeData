Plot a function represented as `x', `y' numerical arrays.

Post link to your resulting image for input arrays (see [[Query Performance|'''Example''' section for Python language on ''Query Performance'' page]]):
 x = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
 y = {2.7, 2.8, 31.4, 38.1, 58.0, 76.2, 100.5, 130.0, 149.3, 180.0};

This task is intended as a subtask for [[Measure relative performance of sorting algorithms implementations]].
