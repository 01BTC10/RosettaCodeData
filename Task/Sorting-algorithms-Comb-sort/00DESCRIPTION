{{Sorting Algorithm}}

The '''Comb Sort''' is a variant of the [[Bubble Sort]]. Like the [[Shell sort]], the Comb Sort increases the gap used in comparisons and exchanges (dividing the gap by <math>(1-e^{-\varphi})^{-1} \approx 1.247330950103979</math> works best, but 1.3 may be more practical). Some implementations use the insertion sort once the gap is less than a certain amount. See the [[wp:Comb sort|article on Wikipedia]].
Variants:
*Combsort11 makes sure the gap ends in (11, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1), which is significantly faster than the other two possible endings
*Combsort with different endings changes to a more efficient sort when the data is almost sorted (when the gap is small). Comb sort with a low gap isn't much better than the Bubble Sort.

Pseudocode:
 '''function''' combsort('''array''' input)
     gap := input'''.size''' ''//initialize gap size''
     '''loop until''' gap = 1 '''and''' swaps = 0
         ''//update the gap value for a next comb. Below is an example''
         gap := int(gap / 1.25)
         '''if''' gap < 1
           ''//minimum gap is 1''
           gap := 1
         '''end if'''
         i := 0
         swaps := 0 ''//see [[Bubble Sort]] for an explanation''
         ''//a single "comb" over the input list''
         '''loop until''' i + gap >= input'''.size''' ''//see [[Shell sort]] for similar idea''
             '''if''' input[i] > input[i+gap]
                 '''swap'''(input[i], input[i+gap])
                 swaps := 1 ''// Flag a swap has occurred, so the''
                            ''// list is not guaranteed sorted''
             '''end if'''
             i := i + 1
         '''end loop'''
     '''end loop'''
 '''end function'''
