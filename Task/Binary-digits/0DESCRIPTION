The task is to output the sequence of binary digits for a given [[wp:Natural number|non-negative integer]].

The decimal value <tt>5</tt>, should produce an output of <tt>101</tt>
The decimal value <tt>50</tt> should produce an output of <tt>110010</tt>
The decimal value <tt>9000</tt> should produce an output of <tt>10001100101000</tt>

The results can be achieved using builtin radix functions within the language, if these are available, or alternatively a user defined function can be used. The output produced should consist just of the binary digits of each number followed by a newline. There should be no other whitespace, radix or sign markers in the produced output, and [[wp:Leading zero|leading zeros]] should not appear in the results.
