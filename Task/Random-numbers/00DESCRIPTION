The goal of this task is to generate a collection filled with 1000 normally distributed random (or pseudorandom)  numbers with a mean of 1.0 and a [[wp:Standard_deviation|standard deviation]] of 0.5

Many libraries only generate uniformly distributed random numbers. If so, use [[wp:Normal_distribution#Generating_values_from_normal_distribution|this formula]] to convert them to a normal distribution.
