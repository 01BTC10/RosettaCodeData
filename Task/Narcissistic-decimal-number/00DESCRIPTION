A [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NarcissisticNumber.html Narcissistic decimal number] is a non-negative integer, <math>n</math> in which if there are <math>m</math> digits in its decimal representation then the sum of all the individual digits of the decimal representation raised to the power <math>m</math> is equal to <math>n</math>.

For example, if <math>n</math> is 153 then <math>m</math>, the number of digits is 3 and we have <math>1^3+5^3+3^3 = 1+125+27 = 153</math> and so 153 is a narcissistic decimal integer number.

The task is to generate and show here, the first 25 narcissistic integer numbers.

<small>Note: <math>0^1 = 0</math>, the first in the series.</small>
