The [[wp:Look and say sequence|Look and say sequence]] is a recursively defined sequence of numbers studied most notably by [[wp:John Horton Conway|John Conway]].

'''Sequence Definition'''
* Take a decimal number
* ''Look'' at the number, visually grouping consecutive runs of the same digit.
* ''Say'' the number, from left to right, group by group; as how many of that digit there are - followed by the digit grouped.
:This becomes the next number of the sequence.

'''An example:'''
* Starting with the number 1, you have ''one'' 1 which produces 11.
* Starting with 11, you have ''two'' 1's i.e. 21
* Starting with 21, you have ''one'' 2, then ''one'' 1 i.e. (12)(11) which becomes 1211
* Starting with 1211 you have ''one'' 1, ''one'' 2, then ''two'' 1's i.e. (11)(12)(21) which becomes 111221

'''Task description'''
:Write a program to generate successive members of the look-and-say sequence.
