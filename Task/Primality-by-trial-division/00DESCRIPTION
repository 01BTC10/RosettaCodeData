Write a boolean function that tells whether a given integer is prime. Remember that 1 and all non-positive numbers are not prime.

Use trial division. Even numbers over two may be eliminated right away. A loop from <span style="font-family:serif">3</span> to <span style="font-family:serif">âˆšn</span> will suffice, but other loops are allowed.
