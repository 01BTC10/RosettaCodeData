Encode a string using an MD5 algorithm. The algorithm can be found on [[wp:Md5#Algorithm|wikipedia]].

Optionally, validate your implementation by running all of the test values in [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321 IETF RFC (1321) for MD5].  Additional the RFC provides more precise information on the algorithm than the Wikipedia article.

{{alertbox|lightgray|'''Warning:''' MD5 has [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6151 known weaknesses], including '''collisions''' and [http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/ forged signatures]. Users may consider a stronger alternative when doing production-grade cryptography, such as SHA-256 (from the SHA-2 family) or the upcoming SHA-3.}}

If the solution on this page is a library solution, see [[MD5/Implementation]] for an implementation from scratch.
