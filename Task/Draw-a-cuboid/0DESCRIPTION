The task is to draw a cuboid with relative dimensions of 2x3x4. The cuboid can be represented graphically, or in ascii art, depending on the language capabilities. To fulfil the criteria of being a cuboid, three faces must be visible. Either static or rotational projection is acceptable for this task.
