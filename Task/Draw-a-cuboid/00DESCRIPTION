The task is to draw a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid cuboid]
with relative dimensions of 2x3x4.

The cuboid can be represented graphically, or in ascii art,
depending on the language capabilities.

To fulfil the criteria of being a cuboid, three faces must be visible. <br>
Either static or rotational projection is acceptable for this task.
