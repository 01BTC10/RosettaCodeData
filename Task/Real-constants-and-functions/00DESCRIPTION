*<math>e</math> (base of the natural logarithm)
*<math>\pi</math>
*square root
*logarithm (any base allowed)
*exponential (<math>e^x</math>)
*absolute value (a.k.a. "magnitude")
*floor (largest integer less than or equal to this number--not the same as truncate or int)
*ceiling (smallest integer not less than this number--not the same as round up)
*power (<math>x^y</math>)
