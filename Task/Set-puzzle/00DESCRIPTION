Set Puzzles are created with a deck of cards from the [[wp:Set (game)|Set Gameâ„¢]]. The object of the puzzle is to find sets of 3 cards in a rectangle of cards that have been dealt face up. There are 81 cards in a deck. Each card contains a unique variation of the following four features: ''color, symbol, number and shading''.

; there are three colors: '''red''', '''green''', or '''purple'''

; there are three symbols: '''oval''', '''squiggle''', or '''diamond'''

; there is a number of symbols on the card: '''one''', '''two''', or '''three'''

; there are three shadings: '''solid''', '''open''', or '''striped'''

Three cards form a ''set'' if each feature is either the same on each card, or is different on each card. For instance: all 3 cards are red, all 3 cards have a different symbol, all 3 cards have a different number of symbols, all 3 cards are striped.

There are two degrees of difficulty: [http://www.setgame.com/set/rules_basic.htm ''basic''] and [http://www.setgame.com/set/rules_advanced.htm ''advanced'']. The basic mode deals 9 cards, that contain exactly 4 sets; the advanced mode deals 12 cards that contain exactly 6 sets. When creating sets you may use the same card more than once. The task is to write code that deals the cards (9 or 12, depending on selected mode) from a shuffled deck in which the total number of sets that could be found is 4 (or 6, respectively); and print the contents of the cards and the sets. For instance:

'''DEALT 9 CARDS:'''

:green, one, oval, striped

:green, one, diamond, open

:green, one, diamond, striped

:green, one, diamond, solid

:purple, one, diamond, open

:purple, two, squiggle, open

:purple, three, oval, open

:red, three, oval, open

:red, three, diamond, solid

'''CONTAINING 4 SETS:'''

:green, one, oval, striped

:purple, two, squiggle, open

:red, three, diamond, solid


:green, one, diamond, open

:green, one, diamond, striped

:green, one, diamond, solid


:green, one, diamond, open

:purple, two, squiggle, open

:red, three, oval, open
