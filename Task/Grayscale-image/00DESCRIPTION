Many image processing algorithms are defined for [[wp:Grayscale|grayscale]] (or else monochromatic) images. Extend the data storage type defined [[Basic_bitmap_storage|on this page]] to support grayscale images. Define two operations, one to convert a color image to a grayscale image and one for the backward conversion. To get luminance of a color use the formula recommended by [http://www.cie.co.at/index_ie.html CIE]:

L = 0.2126·R + 0.7152·G + 0.0722·B

When using floating-point arithmetic make sure that rounding errors would not cause run-time problems or else distorted results when calculated luminance is stored as an unsigned integer.
