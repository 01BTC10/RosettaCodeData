'''Task:''' Create a list of 10 functions, in the simplest manner possible
(anonymous functions are encouraged), such that the function at index <math>i</math>
(you may choose to start <math>i</math> from either 0 or 1), when run,
should return the square of the index, that is, <math>i^2</math>.
Display the result of running any but the last function,
to demonstrate that the function indeed remembers its value.

'''Goal:''' To demonstrate how to create a series of independent closures based on the same template but maintain separate copies of the variable closed over.
In imperative languages, one would generally use a loop with a mutable counter variable.
For each function to maintain the correct number, it has to capture the ''value''
of the variable at the time it was created, rather than just a reference to the variable, which would have a different value by the time the function was run.
