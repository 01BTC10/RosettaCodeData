Define a vector having three dimensions as being represented by an ordered collection of three numbers: (X, Y, Z). If you imagine a graph with the x and y axis being at right angles to each other and having a third, z axis coming out of the page, then a triplet of numbers, (X, Y, Z) would represent a point in the region, and a vector from the origin to the point.

Given vectors <code>A = (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>); B = (b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>3</sub>);</code> and <code>C = (c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>3</sub>);</code> then the following common vector products are defined:
* '''The dot product'''
: A • B = <code>a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>b<sub>2</sub> + a<sub>3</sub>b<sub>3</sub>;</code>  a scalar quantity
* '''The cross product'''
: A x B = <code>(a<sub>2</sub>b<sub>3</sub> - a<sub>3</sub>b<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>b<sub>1</sub> - a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>3</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub> - a<sub>2</sub>b<sub>1</sub>);</code>  a vector quantity
* '''The scalar triple product'''
: A • (B x C);  a scalar quantity
* '''The vector triple product'''
: A x (B x C);  a vector quantity

;Task description
