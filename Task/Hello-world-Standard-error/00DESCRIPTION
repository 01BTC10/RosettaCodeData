{{selection|Short Circuit|Console Program Basics}}A common practice in computing is to send error messages to a different output stream than [[User Output - text|normal text console messages]]. The normal messages print to what is called "standard output" or "standard out". The error messages print to "standard error". This separation can be used to redirect error messages to a different place than normal messages.

Show how to print a message to standard error by printing "Goodbye, World!" on that stream.
