The task is to write a game that follows the following rules:
:The computer will choose a number between given set limits and asks the player for repeated guesses until the player guesses the target number correctly. At each guess, the computer responds with whether the guess was higher than, equal to, or less than the target - or signals that the input was inappropriate.
