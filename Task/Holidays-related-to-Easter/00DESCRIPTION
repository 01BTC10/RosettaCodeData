Calculate the date of [[wp:Easter|Easter]], [[wp:Ascension Thursday|Ascension Thursday]], [[wp:Pentecost|Pentecost]], [[wp:Trinity Sunday|Trinity Sunday]] & [[wp:Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi feast]].

As the example calculate for the first year of each century from 400 to 2100 [[wp:Common Era|CE]] and also for years 2010 to 2020 CE.

[[wp:Metonic cycle|Metonic cycle]]: Taking a year to be 1/19th of this 6940-day cycle gives a year length of 365&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/76 days (the unrounded cycle is much more accurate), which is slightly more than 12 synodic months. To keep the 12-month lunar year in pace with the solar year, an [[wp:intercalary|intercalary]] 13th month would have to be added on seven occasions during the nineteen-year period.  Meton introduced a formula for intercalation in circa&nbsp;432&nbsp;BC.
