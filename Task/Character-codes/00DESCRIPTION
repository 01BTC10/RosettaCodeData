Given a character value in your language, print its code (could be ASCII code, Unicode code, or whatever your language uses).

For example, the character 'a' (lowercase letter A) has a code of 97 in ASCII (as well as Unicode, as ASCII forms the beginning of Unicode).

Conversely, given a code, print out the corresponding character.
