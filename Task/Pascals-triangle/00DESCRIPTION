[[wp:Pascal's triangle|Pascal's triangle]] is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by [[wp:Blaise Pascal|Blaise Pascal]]. Its first few rows look like this:
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
where each element of each row is either 1 or the sum of the two elements right above it. For example, the next row would be 1 (since the first element of each row doesn't have two elements above it), 4 (1 + 3), 6 (3 + 3), 4 (3 + 1), and 1 (since the last element of each row doesn't have two elements above it). Each row <tt>n</tt> (starting with row 0 at the top) shows the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (x + y)<sup>n</sup>.

Write a function that prints out the first n rows of the triangle (with <tt>f(1)</tt> yielding the row consisting of only the element 1). This can be done either by summing elements from the previous rows or using a binary coefficient or combination function. Behavior for <tt>n <= 0</tt> does not need to be uniform, but should be noted.
