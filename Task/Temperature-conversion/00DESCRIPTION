There are quite a number of temperature scales. <br>
For this task we will concentrate on 4 of the perhaps best-known ones: [[wp:Kelvin|Kelvin]], [[wp:Degree Celsius|Celsius]], [[wp:Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit]] and [[wp:Degree Rankine|Rankine]].

The Celsius and Kelvin scales have the same magnitude, but different null points.

:0 degrees Celsius corresponds to '''273.15''' kelvin.
:0 kelvin is absolute zero.

The Fahrenheit and Rankine scales also have the same magnitude,
but different null points.

:0 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds to '''459.67''' degrees Rankine.
:0 degrees Rankine is absolute zero.

The Celsius/Kelvin and Fahrenheit/Rankine scales have a ratio of '''5 : 9'''.

Write code that accepts a value of kelvin, converts it
to values on the three other scales and prints the result.

For instance:
<pre>
K  21.00

C  -252.15

F  -421.87

R  37.80
