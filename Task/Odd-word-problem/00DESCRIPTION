Write a program that solves the [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OddWordProblem odd word problem] with the restrictions given below.

'''Description''': You are promised an input stream consisting of English letters and punctuations.  It is guaranteed that
* the words (sequence of consecutive letters) are delimited by one and only one punctuation; that
* the stream will begin with a word; that
* the words will be at least one letter long; and that
* a full stop (.) appears after, and only after, the last word.

For example, <code>what,is,the;meaning,of:life.</code> is such a stream with six words.  Your task is to reverse the letters in every other word while leaving punctuations intact, producing e.g. "what,si,the;gninaem,of:efil.", while observing the following restrictions:
# Only I/O allowed is reading or writing one character at a time, which means: no reading in a string, no peeking ahead, no pushing characters back into the stream, and no storing characters in a global variable for later use;
# You '''are not''' to explicitly save characters in a collection data structure, such as arrays, strings, hash tables, etc, for later reversal;
# You '''are''' allowed to use recursions, closures, continuations, threads, coroutines, etc., even if their use implies the storage of multiple characters.

'''Test case''': work on both the "life" example given above, and the text <code>we,are;not,in,kansas;any,more.</code>
