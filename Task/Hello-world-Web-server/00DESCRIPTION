The browser is the new [[GUI]] !

The task is to serve our standard text "Goodbye, World!" to http://localhost:8080/ so that it can be viewed with a web browser. <br>
The provided solution must start or implement a server that accepts multiple client connections and serves text as requested.

Note that starting a web browser or opening a new window with this URL
is not part of the task. <br>
Additionally, it is permissible to serve the provided page as a plain text file (there is no requirement to serve properly formatted [[HTML]] here).
The browser will generally do the right thing with simple text like this.
