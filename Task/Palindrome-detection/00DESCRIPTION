Write at least one function/method (or whatever it is called in your preferred
language) to check if a sequence of characters (or bytes) is
a [[wp:Palindrome|palindrome]] or not. The ''function'' must return
a boolean value (or something that can be used as boolean value, like an
integer).

It is not mandatory to write also an example code that uses the ''function'',
unless its usage could be not clear (e.g. the provided recursive C solution
needs explanation on how to call the function).

It is not mandatory to handle properly encodings (see [[String length]]),
i.e. it is admissible that the function does not recognize 'sal&agrave;las' as
palindrome.

The function must not ignore spaces and punctuations. The compliance to the
aforementioned, strict or not, requirements completes the task.

'''Example'''<br>
An example of a Latin palindrome is the sentence
"''In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni''",
roughly translated as: we walk around in the night and we are burnt by the
fire (of love). To do your test with it, you must make it all the same case and
strip spaces.

'''Notes'''<br>
