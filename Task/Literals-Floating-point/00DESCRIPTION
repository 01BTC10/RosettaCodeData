Programming languages have different ways of expressing floating-point literals. Show how floating-point literals can be expressed in your language: decimal or other bases, exponential notation, and any other special features.

You may want to include a regular expression or BNF/ABNF/EBNF defining allowable formats for your language.

See also [[Literals/Integer]].
