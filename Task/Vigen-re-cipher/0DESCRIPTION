Implement a [[wp:Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher|Vigenère cypher]], both encryption and decryption. The program should handle keys and text of unequal length, and should capitalize everything and discard non-alphabetic characters. (If your program handles non-alphabetic characters in another way, make a note of it.)
