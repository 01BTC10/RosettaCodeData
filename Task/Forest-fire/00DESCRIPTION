Implement the Drossel and Schwabl definition of the [[wp:Forest-fire model|forest-fire model]].

It is basically a 2D [[wp:Cellular automaton|cellular automaton]] where each cell can be in three distinct states (''empty'', ''tree'' and ''burning'') and evolves according to the following rules (as given by Wikipedia)

# A burning cell turns into an empty cell
# A tree will burn if at least one neighbor is burning
# A tree ignites with probability ''f'' even if no neighbor is burning
# An empty space fills with a tree with probability ''p''

Neighborhood is the [[wp:Moore neighborhood|Moore neighborhood]]; boundary conditions are so that on the boundary the cells are always empty ("fixed" boundary condition).

At the beginning, populate the lattice with empty and tree cells according to a specific probability (e.g. a cell has the probability 0.5 to be a tree). Then, let the system evolve.

Task's requirements do not include graphical display or the ability to change parameters (probabilities ''p'' and ''f'') through a graphical or command line interface.
