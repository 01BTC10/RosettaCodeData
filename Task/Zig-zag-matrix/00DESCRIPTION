Produce a zig-zag array.
A zig-zag array is a square arrangement of the first <tt>N<sup>2</sup></tt> integers, where the numbers increase sequentially as you zig-zag along the anti-diagonals of the array. <br>
For a graphical representation, see [[wp:Image:JPEG_ZigZag.svg|JPG zigzag]]
(JPG uses such arrays to encode images).

For example, given <tt>5</tt>, produce this array:
<pre>
 0  1  5  6 14
 2  4  7 13 15
 3  8 12 16 21
 9 11 17 20 22
10 18 19 23 24
</pre>
