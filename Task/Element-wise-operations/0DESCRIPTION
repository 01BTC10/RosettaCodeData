Similar to [[Matrix multiplication]] and [[Matrix transposition]], the task is to implement basic element-wise matrix-matrix and scalar-matrix operations, which can be referred to in other, higher-order tasks. Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation.

Extend the task if necessary to include additional basic operations, which should not require their own specialised task.
