A here document (or "heredoc") is a way of specifying a text block, preserving the line breaks, indentation and other whitespace within the text.

Depending on the language being used a here document is constructed using a command followed by "<<" (or some other symbol) followed by a token string.

The text block will then start on the next line, and will be followed by the chosen token at the beginning of the following line, which is used to mark the end of the textblock.

The task is to demonstrate the use of here documents within the language.
