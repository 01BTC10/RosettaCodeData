Write a function which says whether a number is perfect.

[[wp:Perfect_numbers|A perfect number]] is a positive integer that is
the sum of its proper positive divisors excluding the number itself.
Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum
of all of its positive divisors (including itself).

Note: The faster [[Lucas-Lehmer test]] is used to find primes of the form 2<sup>''n''</sup>-1, all ''known'' perfect numbers can be derived from these primes
using the formula (2<sup>''n''</sup> - 1) Ã— 2<sup>''n'' - 1</sup>.
It is not known if there are any odd perfect numbers (any that exist are larger than 10<sup>2000</sup>).
