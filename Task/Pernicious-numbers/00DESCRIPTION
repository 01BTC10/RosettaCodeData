A ''[[wp:Pernicious number|pernicious number]]'' is a positive integer whose [[population count]] is a prime.
<br>The ''population count'' (also known as ''pop count'') is the number of <code>1</code>'s (ones) in the binary representation of a non-negative integer.<br>
For example, <math>22</math> (which is <code>10110</code> in binary) has a population count of <math>3</math>, which is prime and so <math>22</math> is a pernicious number.
