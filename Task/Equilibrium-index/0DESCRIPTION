An equilibrium index of a sequence is an index into the sequence such that the sum of elements at lower indices is equal to the sum of elements at higher indices. For example, in a sequence <math>A</math>:

: <math>A_0 = -7</math>
: <math>A_1 =  1</math>
: <math>A_2 =  5</math>
: <math>A_3 =  2</math>
: <math>A_4 = -4</math>
: <math>A_5 =  3</math>
: <math>A_6 =  0</math>

3 is an equilibrium index, because:

: <math>A_0 + A_1 + A_2 = A_4 + A_5 + A_6</math>

6 is also an equilibrium index, because:

: <math>A_0 + A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 + A_5 = 0</math>

(sum of zero elements is zero)

7 is not an equilibrium index, because it is not a valid index of sequence <math>A</math>.

Write a function that, given a sequence, returns its equilibrium indices (if any).
Assume that the sequence may be very long.
