These two sequences of positive integers are defined as:
:<math>\begin{align}
R(1)&=1\ ;\ S(1)=2 \\
R(n)&=R(n-1)+S(n-1), \quad n>1.
\end{align}</math>
:The sequence <math>S(n)</math> is further defined as the sequence of positive integers ''not'' present in <math>R(n)</math>.
Sequence R starts: 1, 3, 7, 12, 18, ...<br>
Sequence S starts: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, ...

Task:
# Create two functions named ffr and ffs that when given n return R(n) or S(n) respectively.<br><small>(Note that R(1) = 1 and S(1) = 2 to avoid off-by-one errors).</small>
# No maximum value for n should be assumed.
# Calculate and show that the first ten values of R are: 1, 3, 7, 12, 18, 26, 35, 45, 56, and 69
# Calculate and show that the first 40 values of ffr plus the first 960 values of ffs include all the integers from 1 to 1000 exactly once.
