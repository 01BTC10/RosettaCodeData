Take the string "alphaBETA", and demonstrate how to convert it to UPPER-CASE and lower-case. Use the default encoding of a string literal or plain ASCII if there is no string literal in your language. Show any additional case conversion functions (e.g. swapping case, capitalizing the first letter, etc.) that may be included in the library of your language.
