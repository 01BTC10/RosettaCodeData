'''Task''':
* Generate a string with <math>\mathrm{N}</math> opening brackets (“<code>[</code>”) and <math>\mathrm{N}</math> closing brackets (“<code>]</code>”), in some arbitrary order.
* Determine whether the generated string is ''balanced''; that is, whether it consists entirely of pairs of opening/closing brackets (in that order), none of which mis-nest.

'''Examples''':

    (empty)   OK
    []        OK   ][        NOT OK
    [][]      OK   ][][      NOT OK
    [[][]]    OK   []][[]    NOT OK
