Write a program that will list everything in the current folder, similar to the Unix utility “<tt>ls</tt>” [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html] (or the Windows terminal command “<tt>DIR</tt>”). The output must be sorted, but printing extended details and producing multi-column output is not required.

;Example output
For the list of paths:
<pre>/foo/bar
/foo/bar/1
/foo/bar/2
/foo/bar/a
/foo/bar/b</pre>

When the program is executed in `/foo`, it should print:
<pre>bar</pre>
and when the program is executed in `/foo/bar`, it should print:
<pre>1
2
a
b</pre>
