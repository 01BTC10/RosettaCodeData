From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse Wikipedia]:

:In [[wp:modular arithmetic|modular arithmetic]], the '''modular multiplicative inverse''' of an [[integer]] ''a'' [[wp:modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''m'' is an integer ''x'' such that

::<math>a^{-1} \equiv x \pmod{m}.</math>

Or in other words, such that:
:<math>\exists k \in\mathbf{Z},\qquad a\, x = 1 + k\,m</math>

It can be shown that such an inverse exists if and only if a and m are [[wp:coprime|coprime]], but we will ignore this for this task.

Either by implementing the algorithm, by using a dedicated library or by using a builtin function in your language, compute the modular inverse of 42 modulo 2017.
