The '''Objeck Programming Language''' is an [[object-oriented]] computing language with [[functional programming|functional]] features. The language has ties with [[C sharp|C#]], [[Scheme]] and indirectly [[Ruby]]. In this language all data types, except for higher-order functions, are treated as objects. The language contains all of the basic features of a general-purpose (Turing complete) programming language with an emphasis placed on OOP simplicity. 

The programming environment consists of an optimizing compiler, virtual machine with associated [[Garbage collection|garbage collector]] and [[JIT]] compiler along with a command-line debugger. The compiler emits binary [[bytecode]] that is executed by the runtime system. The runtime system has the ability to translate the bytecode into AMD64 or IA-32 machine code on the fly.
