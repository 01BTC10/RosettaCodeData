Jcon is a Java-based implementation of the Icon programming language. The Jcon translator, written in Icon, generates Java class files that execute in conjunction with a run-time system written in Java.

Version 2 of Jcon is an essentially complete implementation of Icon, including graphics and large integers. A few minor features are missing -- mostly things like chdir() that cannot be done in Java.

Jcon is currently not being developed.
