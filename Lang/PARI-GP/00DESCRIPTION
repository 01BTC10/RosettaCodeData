PARI/GP is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory, elliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other useful functions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot of transcendental functions.

PARI/GP is composed of two parts: a [[C]] library called PARI and an interface, gp, to this library. GP scripts are concise, easy to write, and resemble mathematical language.  (Terminology: the scripting language of gp is called GP.)

PARI was written by Henri Cohen and others at Université Bordeaux I and is now maintained by Karim Belabas.  gp was originally written by Dominique Bernardi, then maintained and enhanced by Karim Belabas and Ilya Zakharevich, and finally rewritten by Bill Alombert.

== Using PARI/GP ==
PARI/GP can be downloaded at its official website's [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/download.html download page].

For Windows users precompiled binaries are available: full-featured stable and development versions, plus a nightly build with the very latest changes.

Mac users may find it convenient to download the version from [http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/pari-gp Fink].

Linux users can install PARI/GP with their favorite package manager (RPM, dpkg, apt, etc.) or build it from source. [http://math.crg4.com/software.html#pari Instructions] are available for compiling.

[https://code.google.com/p/paridroid/ paridroid] is a port to Android tablets and phones. While an iPhone/iPad version has not been developed, [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sage-math/id496492945?mt=8 sage-math] includes PARI and GP commands can be involved with the wrapper function <code>pari</code>.

== Coding with PARI ==
The most common way to use PARI is through the gp calculator, using its own scripting language, GP.  But there are other interfaces to PARI beside gp:
* [http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~ramare/ServeurPerso/GP-PARI/ PariEmacs]
* [http://go.helms-net.de/sw/paritty/pari_tty_einf_en.html Pari-tty]
* [http://www.skalatan.de/pariguide/ pariGUIde]

If you want to write a program rather than script a calculator, many languages are supported:
* [[C]]: PARI is written in C, so it's very easy to either write your own programs or extend gp using C.
* [[C++]]: With appropriate linkage specification it is possible to use PARI directly in C++ as well. The code is intentionally written in a C++-compatible style.
* [[Python]]: [http://www.sagemath.org/ SAGE] is a Python-based system that includes PARI among others; there is a [http://code.google.com/p/pari-python/ pari-python] library as well.
* [[Perl]]: Use [http://search.cpan.org/dist/Math-Pari/ Math::Pari] or [https://github.com/FreeMonad/GPP GPP].
* [[Common Lisp]]: Use [http://clisp.sourceforge.net/impnotes/pari.html Pari] ([[CLISP]]).
