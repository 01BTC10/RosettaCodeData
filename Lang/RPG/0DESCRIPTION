{{language}}
RPG II, III, 400 and RPG IV are a family of languages created and primarily distributed by [[IBM]]. The initials initially stood for '''Report Program Generator''', though that usage is no longer in vogue. These languages were widely used for the IBM S/3, S/32, S/34, S/36, S/38 and AS/400 midrange computers.

The latest version of RPG ( RPG IV or RPGLE ) contains features such as prototyped functions and procedures, static and dynamic binding, access to C routine libraries, dynamic link libraries, and fully recursive and re-entrant modular code.
