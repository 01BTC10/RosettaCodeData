'''JavaScript''' is the name of Netscape Communications Corporation's implementation of the [[ECMAScript standard]], a scripting language based on the concept of prototype-based programming. The language is best known for its use in websites (as client-side JavaScript), but is also used to enable scripting access to objects embedded in other applications.

Despite the name, JavaScript is only distantly related to the [[Java]] programming language, the main similarity being their common debt to the [[C]] syntax. Semantically, JavaScript syntax has far more in common with the [[Self]] [[programming language]].

JavaScript is a registered trademark of [[Sun Microsystems]], Inc. It was used under license for technology invented and implemented by Netscape Communications and current entities such as the Mozilla Foundation.

JavaScript has been born again, now that [[AJAX]] has come up. The meaning of this is simply that [[AJAX]] has shown that JavaScript is really still useful in a lot of domains and that (most) web pages that use it can be given a whole new life.

There's a nice table on Wikipedia that shows which version of JavaScript is release in which version of a browser: [[wp:JavaScript#Versions]]
