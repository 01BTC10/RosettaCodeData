The Euler Mathematical Toolbox is a powerful, versatile, mature software for numerical and symbolic computations written and maintained by R. Grothmann, associate professor of mathmetics at the University of Eichst√§tt. Euler is similar to [[MATLAB]], but has an own style, and a slightly different syntax. Symbolic mathematics is supported in Euler using the open algebra system [[Maxima]]. It contains a matrix language, a graphical notebook style interface, a plot window and can handle real, complex and interval numbers, vectors and matrices, it can produce 2D/3D plots
