Revolution is an interpreted language created by [http://www.runrev.com Runtime Revolution]

It is descended from HyperCard/HyperTalk, but extends that heritage by:
*Running on OS X, Mac Classic, Windows, Unix, and in modern web browsers
*Having a full interface toolkit with native widgets on all platforms
*Incorporating modern language features like regex, associative arrays, support for internet protocols, etc.
*Last but not least, supporting color natively (HyperCard die-hards are now breathing a sigh of relief)
