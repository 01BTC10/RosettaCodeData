{{language|Brainf***|bnf=http://ninh.nl/blog/2008/10/25/brainfck-birds-of-a-feather-session-take-2/}}Also known as '''Brainfuck''', but identified as '''Brainf***''' for reasons described [[Rosetta Code:Brainf***|here]]. Created by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993 in an attempt to create the world's smallest Turing-complete compiler. It is noted as an [[:Category:Esoteric_Languages|esoteric programming language]], as it is not ordinarily used for applications development, but it also noted as being a minimalist language.

The construct for the language is similar to a [[wp:Turing Machine|Turing Machine]]. The commands themselves act on an array or "tape" (usually a byte or integer array and usually "infinite" on one or both ends) and a pointer to a position in that array. The complete specification for the language can be summed up with the following eight symbols:

{| class="wikitable"
!align="center"|Character
!align="left" |Meaning
|-
|style="text-align:center"|<tt>></tt>
||increment the pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).
|-
|style="text-align:center"|<tt><</tt>
||decrement the pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).
|-
|style="text-align:center"|<tt>+</tt>
||increment (increase by one) the byte at the pointer.
|-
|style="text-align:center"|<tt>-</tt>
||decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the pointer.
|-
|style="text-align:center"|<tt>.</tt>
||output the value of the byte at the pointer (usually interpreted to a character).
|-
|style="text-align:center"|<tt>,</tt>
||accept one byte of input (usually interpreted from a character), storing its value in the byte at the pointer.
|-
|style="text-align:center"|<tt>[</tt>
||jump forward to the command after the corresponding <tt>]</tt> if the byte at the pointer is zero.
|-
|style="text-align:center"|<tt>]</tt>
||jump back to the command after the corresponding <tt>[</tt> if the byte at the pointer is nonzero.
|}

Alternatively, the <tt>]</tt> command may instead be translated as an unconditional jump '''to''' the corresponding <tt>[</tt> command, or vice versa; programs will behave the same but will run more slowly.

All other symbols, including traditional whitespace characters, are interpreted as comments.

Due to this minimal instruction set, Brainf*** is used as an introduction to compilers and has even been successfully implemented as a microprocessor core and the foundation to an operating system using a slightly extended syntax for output.
