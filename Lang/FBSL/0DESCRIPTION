FBSL means “Freestyle BASIC Language Script”.
Like many modern programming languages
contains flavours of [[Visual BASIC]], [[QBasic]], [[PHP]], [[Pascal]] and [[C++]].
It is a kind of hybrid language hence the “Freestyle”.
It is especially designed for the [[win32]] platform ([[Windows 95 SR2]] to [[Windows VISTA]]).
It is compatible with, and completely functional under, [[LINUX]] [[Wine]].
