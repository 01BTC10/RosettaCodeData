'''[[wp:SQL|Structured Query Language]]''' (SQL) is the ''lingua franca'' for modifying and performing queries in database systems based on Dr. Edgar F. Codd's relational model. (Dr. Codd did not create the SQL language itself.) 

It is mostly declarative, but each database vendor has extended their dialect of SQL in various incompatible ways to give it more power or to simplify their implementation.
