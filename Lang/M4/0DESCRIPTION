‘m4’ is a macro processor, in the sense that it copies its input to the output, expanding macros as it goes.  Macros are either builtin or user-defined, and can take any number of arguments.  Besides just doing macro expansion, ‘m4’ has builtin functions for including named files, running shell commands, doing integer arithmetic, manipulating text in various ways, performing recursion, etc....  ‘m4’ can be used either as a front-end to a compiler, or as a macro processor in its own right.

(Excerpt from the GNU info page of m4)

One implementation of this Unix macro processor m4 is the GNU m4
