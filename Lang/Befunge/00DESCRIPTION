{{language|Befunge}}
'''Befunge''' is an esoteric programming language invented by Chris Pressey in 1993. It is unusual for having a two-dimensional toroidal code space. Commands are single characters. The instruction pointer can move up, down, left, and right across the source. The original specification is known as Befunge-93, which was later updated with additional features as Befunge-98.

Befunge was the first of a family of languages referred to as "Funges". In addition to the "normal" 2-dimensional layout, there is a 1-dimension variant called '''Unefunge''', a 3-dimensional variant called '''Trefunge''', and an ''N''-dimensional variant called '''Nefunge'''.
