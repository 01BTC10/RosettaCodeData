{{alertbox|#ffffe0|''Were you looking for the [[Common Lisp]] library? That category has now been [[:Category:Babel (library)|renamed]].''}}
{{language}}Babel is an interpreted language designed by Clayton Bauman. It is an untyped, stack-based, postfix language with support for arrays, lists and maps (dictionaries). Babel 1.0 will support built-in crypto-based verification of code in order to enable safer remote code execution.

Babel is implemented in [[C]] (compiles on MinGW32). It is still under development, so please excuse the dust and debris in the [https://github.com/claytonkb/clean_babel current implementation]. To get started quickly on Windows, clone the repository and run bin/babel.exe from the repo directory. Type 'rc !' (no quotes) to load the rc file and get some convenience operators. Since this is a development build, you can type '0 dev' to view the dev options. To build on Windows, use MinGW32; on Linux, use gcc.
