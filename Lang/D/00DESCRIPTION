'''D''' is an [[object-oriented]], [[imperative programming|imperative]], multi-[[:Category:Programming Paradigms|paradigm]] system programming language by Walter Bright of Digital Mars. It originated as a re-engineering of [[C++]], but even though it is predominantly influenced by that language, it is not a variant of C++. D has redesigned some C++ features and has been influenced by concepts used in other programming languages, such as [[Python]], [[Java]], [[C sharp|C#]] and [[Eiffel]].
