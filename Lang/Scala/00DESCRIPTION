{{language programming paradigm|functional}}
{{language programming paradigm|object-oriented}}
{{language programming paradigm|generic}}Scala is a hybrid [[functional programming|Functional]]/[[object-oriented|OO]] language developed by Martin Odersky and his team at [http://lamp.epfl.ch/ LAMP]. Scala compiles to [[runs on vm::Java Virtual Machine|JVM]] [[bytecode]], and can inter-operate with [[Java]] code. Running as a .Net [[Common Language Runtime]] application is also supported.

The language is most focused on the results of the program, therefor the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful considered harmful] technical computer oriented concepts like threads, semaphore, pointers, goto- and break statements to struggle with are not there. For parallel processing (that very simple can archived) these concept are present but not visible to the programmer.

The problem with rosetta.org is that lot of tasks addresses the technical "features" of goto's, break, continue, side effects, pointers, type-casting, weak-typing and so on are deliberate not Scala's cup of tea.
