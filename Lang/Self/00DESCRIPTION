'''Self''' is an [[object-oriented]] programming language based on the concept of prototypes. It was used primarily as an experimental test system for language design in the 1980s and 1990s; however, as of July of 2006, Self is still being actively developed as part of the Klein project which is a Self virtual machine written entirely in Self. The latest major version is 4.3, which was released in July 2006.
