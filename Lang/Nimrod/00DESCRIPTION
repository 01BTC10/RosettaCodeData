{{language programming paradigm|imperative}}
Nimrod is a general purpose, high-level, system programming, statically typed imperative compiled programming language that is developed by Andreas Rumpf. There is a lot of focus on portability and efficiency. The language compiles to C and supports many C compilers. Nimrod is actively being developed although it could use more developers, there is currently only one core developer. The language has excellent [http://nimrod-code.org/lib.html documentation], and a very good [http://nimrod-code.org/tut1.html tutorial].
